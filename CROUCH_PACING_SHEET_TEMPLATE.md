# CROUCH PACING SHEET (Template)

Use this as a chapter-level rhythm layer on top of:
- `BEAT_SHEET_TEMPLATE.md` (macro spine)
- `BEAT_TRACKING_TEMPLATE.md` (coverage control)
- `TODO_INDEX_TEMPLATE.md` (execution plan)

## Core Rules (Keep It Propulsive)
1. **End every chapter with motion:** a question, a reveal, a new constraint, or a decision.
2. **Alternate “answer” and “complication”:** each chapter resolves *one* thing and creates *one* bigger problem.
3. **Escalate by rule-change:** every 2–3 chapters, add or revise a rule (what’s possible, what’s safe, who can be trusted).
4. **Midpoint = premise flip:** the goal, enemy, or mechanism changes meaningfully (not just “more danger”).
5. **Late act sprint:** shorten scenes, reduce locations, increase irreversible actions.

## Reveal Cadence (Simple Pattern)
- **Ch 1:** Hook + itch (something off)
- **Ch 2:** First answer + bigger question
- **Ch 3:** Complication + cost
- **Ch 4:** Point-of-no-return (commit / threshold)
- **Ch 5–6:** Progress + setback (one reveal)
- **Ch 7:** Rule change / twist (premise expands)
- **Ch 8:** Midpoint flip (reframe)
- **Ch 9–11:** Chase the new truth (two reveals, mounting cost)
- **Ch 12:** All-is-lost / collapse
- **Ch 13–14:** New plan + execution (decisions over investigation)
- **Ch 15:** Climax (irreversible act)
- **Ch 16:** Resolution + optional sting/echo

Adjust chapter count as needed; keep the *functions* (threshold, flip, collapse) even if counts change.

## Prompt Pack (If You Get Stuck)
- **New constraint ideas:** time pressure, access denied, ally flips, evidence invalidated, location becomes dangerous, resource loss, moral line crossed.
- **Reveal types:** “it’s bigger than we thought”, “it was us”, “rules are inverted”, “the enemy is closer”, “the goal was wrong”.
- **Cost types:** relationship damage, physical harm, exposure risk, loss of safe place, public escalation, irreversible choice.

## Integration Notes (Avoid Leaks)
- Beats still rule: only pace within the assigned beats; don’t add plot facts in editing phases.
- If a “twist” creates new continuity, record it in `CONTINUITY_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` and update beat tracking.

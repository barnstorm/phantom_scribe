# Dread Ladder (Horror Escalation Template)

Use this to keep horror escalating *coherently*: safety erodes, rules tighten, and the threat becomes unavoidable without turning random.

This is a horror-specific overlay that pairs well with:
- Macro turns: `HARMON_STORY_CIRCLE_TEMPLATE.md`
- Chapter rhythm: `CROUCH_PACING_SHEET_TEMPLATE.md`
- Scene pivots: `REVERSAL_LADDER_TEMPLATE.md`
- Rule integrity: `constraint-designer`, `canon-keeper`, `timeline-keeper`

## Core Principle

Horror escalates when the protagonist loses **options**, not just comfort.

Track three things as a ladder:
1) **Knowledge** (they understand more)
2) **Cost** (it hurts more)
3) **Agency** (they can do less)

Your job is to increase (1) and (2) while reducing (3).

## Threat Rule Card (Fill First)

- **Threat name:**  
- **Threat type:** (entity / phenomenon / contagion / environment / institution / self)  
- **What it wants (or what it does):**  
- **Exposure vector:** (how it reaches you)  
- **Constraint:** (what it cannot do / where it cannot go)  
- **Cost to resist:** (what resistance consumes)  
- **Failure mode:** (what happens when you lose)  
- **False safety:** (what seems safe but isn’t)  
- **Tell:** (the smallest sign it’s near)

## Dread Beats (8-stage ladder)

1) **Itch** – Something is off, deniable.
2) **Confirmation** – Evidence appears; denial becomes costly.
3) **Rule Glimpse** – A constraint/cost is revealed (partial rulebook).
4) **First Bite** – Real harm (or irrevocable consequence) happens.
5) **Safety Inversion** – A safe place/person becomes unsafe.
6) **No Clean Exit** – Escape creates worse outcomes; agency collapses.
7) **Confrontation** – They must act under degraded options.
8) **Aftermath / Residue** – The world is changed; some horror persists (or a hard closure).

## Chapter Escalation Grid

Fill 8–16 rows depending on chapter count; combine stages if shorter.

| Ch | Dread Stage | What gets worse? (options lost) | New rule / cost revealed | Set-piece / scare type | End hook (cliff) | Notes |
|----:|------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------|------|
| 1  | Itch        |                                  |                          |                        |                  |      |

## Set-Piece Builder (Use for Big Scenes)

1) **Approach:** what they want (ordinary goal)
2) **Omen:** small tell (deniable)
3) **Breach:** threshold crossed (point of no return)
4) **Scramble:** constraint bites (options collapse)
5) **Cost:** payment (injury, loss, exposure, moral compromise)
6) **New rule:** what they learn (and what becomes impossible)
7) **Exit hook:** what follows them out

## Guardrails (Avoid Cheap Horror)
- Don’t use coincidence as the primary engine; make scares *causal*.
- Reveal rules slowly, but keep them consistent.
- Escalate by **taking away** resources: allies, credibility, time, safe places.
- If you add a new rule, record it in `world/WORLD_BIBLE.md` and check with `canon-keeper`.

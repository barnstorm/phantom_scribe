# START HERE – CHARACTER ROLEPLAY (Template)

**Purpose:** Optional voice-testing tool: improv scenes in-character to check voice consistency and dialogue authenticity.

## When to Use
- After character references are defined.
- Before or during line editing to validate dialogue tone.
- For tricky conversations or key emotional beats.

## How to Run
1) Pick character(s) and scene context (what they know, where they are).  
2) Improvise brief dialogue in their voices (no new plot info).  
3) Compare output to reference docs: does it sound like them?  
4) Adjust dialogue in chapters if voice drift is detected.

## Guardrails
- Do not introduce new plot facts; stay within established knowledge.
- Keep it short—goal is voice calibration, not story expansion.
- Log takeaways if they affect current edits.

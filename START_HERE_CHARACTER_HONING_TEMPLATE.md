# START HERE – CHARACTER HONING (Template)

**Purpose:** Ensure character and location consistency (facts, knowledge, emotional state) without altering plot.

## Scope
- Phase: After draft/structural beats are in place.
- Focus: Biographical details, timeline knowledge, voice consistency.
- Do not: Change plot beats or add new reveals.

## Workflow
1) Establish references: create/update `CHARACTER_REFERENCE` and `PLACE_REFERENCE` docs.  
2) For each chapter: read, compare against refs, note contradictions/gaps.  
3) Fix factual inconsistencies (ages, names, appearances, knowledge).  
4) Log actions in the character honing log (`PASS_LOG_TEMPLATES.md`).  
5) Avoid stylistic rewrites; keep changes minimal and factual.

## Checklist (per chapter)
- Names/relationships correct.
- Ages/timeline alignment (dates, season, time of day).
- Knowledge: character only knows what they should at this point.
- Emotional state: consistent with prior events.
- Physical description: consistent (injuries, clothing, items carried).
- Locations: details match reference doc.

## Outputs
- Updated reference docs as needed.
- Chapter-level log entries (changes + open questions).
- Flags for structural/continuity follow-up if new conflicts emerge.

# BEAT TRACKING (Template)

**Purpose:** Track beat coverage and prevent gaps or skips. Adapt columns as needed.

| Beats | Chapter | Filename | Status | Notes |
|-------|---------|----------|--------|-------|
| 1-2   | Ch 1    | `chapter_01_xxx.md` | ✅/⚠️/❌ | e.g., needs date check |
| 3-4   | Ch 2    | `chapter_02_xxx.md` | ...    | ...   |
| ...   | ...     | ...      | ...    | ...   |

**Statuses:** ✅ Complete | ⚠️ Needs review | ❌ Missing

## Session Management (Optional)
- At ~50% resource budget, wrap current chapter, update this file, and start a fresh session.

## Verification Rules
Before marking a chapter complete, confirm:
1. All assigned beats are present.
2. Timeline/date/location align with prior chapters.
3. File name and chapter numbering match.
4. Transitions make sense from previous chapter(s).

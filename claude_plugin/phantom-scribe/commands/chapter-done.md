description: Run a chapter-done check (beats, momentum, canon safety) and list required tracker updates
---

Use the `chapter-checker` agent on the chapter the user just drafted/edited.

Ask for:
1) Chapter text (or file path)
2) Intended beats for this chapter
3) Prior chapter summary (1–3 sentences)

Output:
- Beat coverage check
- Continuity risks (timeline, knowledge gating, state)
- Momentum fields (start question, answer, end hook, cost)
- Required updates (beat tracker, TODO index, improvements log, world bible/headcanon adoption)

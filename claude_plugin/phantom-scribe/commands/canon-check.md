description: Check a scene/chapter against canon rules and propose minimal fixes
---

Ask the user for:
1) The scene/chapter text (or file path)
2) Canon docs (world bible, timeline, references), if any
3) Where this scene sits in the arc

Then invoke `canon-keeper` to produce:
- Pass/fail/conditional, confirmed canon, violations with severity, questions, and minimal-fix options.

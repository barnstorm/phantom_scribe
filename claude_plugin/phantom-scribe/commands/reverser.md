description: Reverse-engineer an existing draft into a 1–2 page thumbnail + vibe read + canon extraction plan
---

Use the `reverser` agent.

Ask for:
1) The story text (full draft or chapters; if long, request chunks)
2) Intended genre + target vibe
3) What feels “not so great” (1–3 bullets)
4) Any existing canon docs (WORLD_BIBLE, CHARACTER_REFERENCE, OPEN_QUESTIONS, CLUE_LEDGER)

Output:
- 1–2 page executive synopsis (thumbnail)
- Current vibe diagnosis (strengths + friction points)
- Harmon mapping + pacing diagnosis
- Canon extraction “changes to apply” list for world/character/open questions/clues
- Next actions (minimal, high-leverage)

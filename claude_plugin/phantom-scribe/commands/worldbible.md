description: Build or update a world bible from provided chapters/excerpts
---

Ask the user for:
1) The text to extract from (chapters or excerpts)
2) Any existing canon docs to merge
3) Hardness preference (hard rules vs soft ambiguity)

Invoke `worldbible-builder` and output a structured `WORLD_BIBLE.md` draft.

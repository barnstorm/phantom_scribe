description: Adopt selected headcanon hooks into WORLD_BIBLE.md and/or CHARACTER_REFERENCE.md explicitly
---

Use the `accept-headcanon` agent.

Ask for:
1) The exact hook bullets to adopt (copy/paste).
2) Whether they are **Canonical now** or still **Candidates**.
3) Effective chapter/beat (when it becomes true / when it’s revealed).
4) Target files (defaults):
   - `world/WORLD_BIBLE.md`
   - `characters/CHARACTER_REFERENCE.md`

Then:
- Write/append a dated adoption record to the chosen docs.
- If the hook touches rules or chronology, recommend running `canon-keeper` / `timeline-keeper`.

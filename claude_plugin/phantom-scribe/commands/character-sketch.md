description: Generate a write-safe character sketch plus labeled headcanon hooks
---

Use the `character-sketcher` agent to create a character sketch from "$ARGUMENTS".

If the user provides only a name, ask for:
- character role (POV/antagonist/ally)
- story thumbnail (or current arc summary)
- tone + rule hardness
- any must/avoid constraints

Output:
- Canon Baseline (write-safe)
- Headcanon Hooks (explicitly non-canon until accepted)
- Optional short voice sample with no new plot facts

description: Manage an intentional canon change (old -> new) and generate a propagation checklist
---

Ask the user for:
1) Old → new change statement
2) Reason + scope (which chapters are “locked”)
3) Canon docs (world bible, timeline, character/location refs)

Invoke `retcon-manager` and output blast radius + checklist + verification plan.

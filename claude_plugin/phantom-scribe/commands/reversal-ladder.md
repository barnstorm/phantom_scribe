description: Build a scene-by-scene reversal ladder for a thriller chapter
---

Use the `reversal-ladder` agent.

Ask for:
1) Chapter purpose (what must change by the end)
2) POV(s)
3) Current outline or draft
4) Constraints (canon/timeline)
5) Desired intensity (low/med/high)

Output:
- Scene ladder (goal → plan → obstacle → reversal → forced move → cliff button)
- “Because of that…” chain
- Flags for any canon/timeline follow-up

# START HERE – LINE EDITING (Template)

**Purpose:** Improve prose (clarity, pacing, voice) without changing plot/continuity.

## Scope
- Phase: After structural/continuity is locked.
- Focus: Sentence-level flow, rhythm, diction, dialogue authenticity.
- Do not: Alter beats, plot, or timeline; avoid new continuity risk.

## Workflow
1) Read the prior chapter(s) to re-anchor voice/tone.  
2) Edit one chapter at a time; log changes.  
3) Keep a parking lot for questions that affect other chapters; don’t chase them mid-pass.  
4) Update pass log (`PASS_LOG_TEMPLATES.md`) per chapter.  
5) If you adjust continuity, note it for a follow-up structural check.

## Checklist (per chapter)
- Voice: POV consistent; character voices distinct.
- Clarity: Remove ambiguity; tighten muddled sentences.
- Pace: Vary sentence length; trim draggy beats.
- Dialogue: Natural cadence; tags and beats support intent.
- Redundancy: Cut repeats of ideas already established.
- Imagery: Specific sensory details; avoid cliché.
- Transitions: Entry/exit cues clear (time/location shifts).

## Logging
- Record: What you changed, open questions, word count delta (optional), status.
- Note any items that need author approval or structural follow-up.

## Hand-off
- Summarize changes and risks at the end of the session.
- Flag any chapter that needs re-read after upstream fixes.

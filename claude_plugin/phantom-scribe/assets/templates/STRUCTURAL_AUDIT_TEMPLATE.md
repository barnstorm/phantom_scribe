# STRUCTURAL AUDIT GUIDE (Template)

Use this to structure a structural pass: verifying beats, continuity, and chapter readiness.

## Inputs
- Beat map (`BEAT_TRACKING_TEMPLATE.md`)
- Draft chapters (file list)
- Timeline/locations reference (if any)

## Steps
1. Read previous chapter(s) to establish state.
2. Verify beat coverage for the current chapter.
3. Check timeline/date/location consistency.
4. Confirm character knowledge/emotional state aligns with prior events.
5. Note duplication or missing exposition.
6. Log findings per chapter (use `CONTINUITY_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`).

## Output
- Chapter-by-chapter notes (issues + strengths).
- List of required fixes with files/lines.
- Updated beat tracker and TODOs.

## Common Checks
- Beat presence: none skipped or doubled.
- Transitions: smooth entry/exit, temporal cues clear.
- Names/ages/locations: consistent with references.
- File naming/numbering: chapter numbers match filenames and beat ranges.
- Voice: POV and tense consistent.

# 📝 EDITING PHASE OVERVIEW

**Status:** Ready to Begin
**Project:** Polybius (46,000-word novel)
**Core Writing:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## 🎯 THREE-PHASE EDITING PROCESS

The novel is written and continuity-checked. Now we refine through **three distinct editing passes**, each with its own focus and token budget.

### Phase Order (MUST be done sequentially):

```
1. CHARACTER & PLACE HONING
   ↓
2. LINE EDITING
   ↓
3. COPY EDITING
   ↓
DONE!
```

**Do NOT skip ahead. Each phase builds on the previous one.**

---

## 📋 PHASE 1: CHARACTER & PLACE HONING

**File:** `START_HERE_CHARACTER_HONING.md`

**Purpose:** Ensure all character details and place descriptions are consistent throughout

**Token Budget:** ~80-100k tokens (one session or split into two)

**What You Do:**
- **⚡ Use character-profiler agent** to create master reference documents
- Check each chapter for consistency
- Fix contradictions in physical descriptions, ages, names
- Verify character knowledge is appropriate to timeline
- Ensure place descriptions don't contradict

**What You DON'T Do:**
- Change plot or beats (LOCKED)
- Rewrite sentences for style
- Fix typos or grammar

**Output:**
- `CHARACTER_REFERENCE.md` (master character details)
- `PLACE_REFERENCE.md` (master location details)
- `CHARACTER_HONING_LOG.md` (tracking document)
- All chapters marked ✅ HONED

**Estimated Time:** 8-12 hours (22 chapters)

---

## 📋 PHASE 2: LINE EDITING

**File:** `START_HERE_LINE_EDITING.md`

**Purpose:** Polish prose at sentence level for flow, clarity, and impact

**Token Budget:** ~100-150k tokens (likely needs 2 sessions)

**What You Do:**
- Improve sentence structure and flow
- Strengthen weak verbs
- Eliminate redundant words
- Vary sentence rhythm
- Enhance clarity
- Polish emotional beats
- **⚡ MANDATORY: Use dialogue-editor agent for ALL dialogue** (every conversation, every exchange)
- **⚡ Optional: Use character-roleplay agent** to test character voice authenticity

**What You DON'T Do:**
- Change plot, beats, or continuity (LOCKED)
- Alter character details (already HONED)
- Over-polish the same sentence repeatedly

**Output:**
- `LINE_EDITING_LOG.md` (tracking document)
- All chapters marked ✅ EDITED
- Significantly improved prose quality

**Estimated Time:** 12-20 hours (22 chapters, more intensive)

**Warning:** Most token-intensive phase. Split into 2 sessions:
- Session 1: Chapters 1-12
- Session 2: Chapters 13-22

---

## 📋 PHASE 3: COPY EDITING

**File:** `START_HERE_COPY_EDITING.md`

**Purpose:** Fix mechanical errors (typos, grammar, punctuation)

**Token Budget:** ~40-60k tokens (one session, should be fast)

**What You Do:**
- Fix typos and spelling
- Correct grammar errors
- Standardize punctuation
- Fix formatting inconsistencies
- Mechanical scan only

**What You DON'T Do:**
- Rewrite sentences (too late!)
- Change word choice (already done!)
- Question style decisions (locked!)

**Output:**
- `COPY_EDITING_LOG.md` (tracking document)
- All chapters marked ✅ CLEAN
- Error-free manuscript

**Estimated Time:** 6-8 hours (22 chapters, fast mechanical work)

**Note:** Fastest phase. If taking longer, you're overthinking it.

---

## 🔋 TOTAL TOKEN BUDGET ACROSS ALL PHASES

**Estimated Total:** 220-310k tokens
- Phase 1: 80-100k
- Phase 2: 100-150k
- Phase 3: 40-60k

**Reality Check:** This will require **2-4 sessions** total:
- Session 1: Character Honing (all chapters)
- Session 2: Line Edit Chapters 1-12
- Session 3: Line Edit Chapters 13-22
- Session 4: Copy Edit (all chapters)

**Or more conservatively:**
- Sessions 1-2: Character Honing (split at Ch 12)
- Sessions 3-4: Line Editing (split at Ch 12)
- Session 5: Copy Editing (all)

---

## 📊 WHAT'S LOCKED (DO NOT CHANGE)

Across ALL editing phases, these are **FIXED:**

**Story Structure:**
- All 47 beats (BEAT_TRACKING.md)
- Chapter sequence and breaks
- Act structure
- Timeline (November 2017)

**Continuity:**
- All fixes already applied (CONTINUITY_REPORT.md)
- Character arcs
- Plot points
- Network of 14 entangled minds
- Three branches concept
- Quantum mechanics logic

**Content:**
- No new scenes
- No deleted scenes
- No plot changes
- No character motivation changes

**You're ONLY improving:**
- Consistency (Phase 1)
- Prose quality (Phase 2)
- Mechanical correctness (Phase 3)

## 💡 SUCCESS TIPS

**For Character Honing:**
- **Use character-profiler agent** to create references (faster & more thorough)
- Work efficiently, don't re-read unnecessarily
- Trust your notes and agent output

**For Line Editing:**
- This is the slowest phase - budget accordingly
- **EVERY dialogue scene must go through dialogue-editor agent** (no exceptions!)
- **Consider using character-roleplay agent** to test character voice before editing dialogue
- Don't over-polish prose - "good enough" is good enough
- Split into multiple sessions if needed
- Focus on high-impact chapters (1-3, 18-22)
- Track dialogue agent usage in your log

**For Copy Editing:**
- Work FAST - this is mechanical
- Set timers per chapter
- Don't turn it into line editing 2.0
- Trust your eye

**For All Phases:**
- Token management is CRITICAL
- One chapter at a time
- Document as you go
- Stop at 100k tokens per session

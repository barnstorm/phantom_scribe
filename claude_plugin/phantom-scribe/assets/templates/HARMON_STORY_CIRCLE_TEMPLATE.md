# HARMON STORY CIRCLE (Template)

An 8-beat structural loop (Dan Harmon) that pairs well with fast, Crouch-like pacing.
Use this as a *macro* map, then break each beat into sub-beats/chapters.

## The 8 Beats
1. **YOU (Comfort Zone):** Who is the protagonist in their normal state?
2. **NEED (Desire):** What do they want (or what problem is introduced)?
3. **GO (Enter Unfamiliar):** They cross a threshold into a new situation.
4. **SEARCH (Adapt):** They learn rules, meet allies/enemies, take actions.
5. **FIND (Get What They Wanted):** They achieve a goal or reach a major reveal.
6. **TAKE (Pay a Price):** Consequences hit; they lose something, moral cost.
7. **RETURN (Back to Familiar):** They head back / attempt to restore order.
8. **CHANGE (New Normal):** They’re transformed; the world is different.

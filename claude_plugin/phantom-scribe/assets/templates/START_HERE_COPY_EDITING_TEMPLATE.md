# START HERE – COPY EDITING (Template)

**Purpose:** Mechanical cleanup: typos, grammar, punctuation, formatting consistency. No plot/voice changes.

## Scope
- Phase: After line edits are done.
- Focus: Surface-level correctness; style consistency.
- Do not: Rewrite sentences for style; alter meaning or continuity.

## Workflow
1) Run a spellcheck pass (manual + tools as allowed).  
2) Read aloud or line-by-line for punctuation and grammar.  
3) Standardize style choices (quotes, ellipses, dashes, numerals, capitalization).  
4) Verify formatting (headings, scene breaks, italics).  
5) Update copy-edit log (`PASS_LOG_TEMPLATES.md`) per chapter.

## Checklist (per chapter)
- Spelling/typos corrected.
- Grammar: subject-verb agreement, tense consistency, pronoun clarity.
- Punctuation: commas/periods/quotes; consistent dialog punctuation.
- Style: consistent dash type, ellipsis spacing, number formatting (words vs digits).
- Formatting: headings/scene breaks uniform; italic usage consistent.
- Names/terms: consistent spelling and capitalization.

## Hand-off
- Note any intentional style deviations.
- Flag unresolved style decisions for the team (e.g., serial comma, numeral rules).

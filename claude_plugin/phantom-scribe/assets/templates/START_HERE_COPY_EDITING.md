# 📝 COPY EDITING - START HERE

**Phase:** Mechanical Correctness Pass
**Purpose:** Fix typos, grammar, punctuation, and formatting errors
**Status:** Ready to begin (after Line Editing complete)

---

## 🔄 WORKFLOW INTEGRATION

**This is Phase 4 (FINAL) of the editing workflow:**
1. ✅ **Structural Audit** (START_HERE_STRUCTURAL_AUDIT.md) - Verify beat alignment and causality
2. ✅ **Character Honing** (START_HERE_CHARACTER_HONING.md) - Lock character/place consistency
3. ✅ **Line Editing** (START_HERE_LINE_EDITING.md) - Polish prose quality
4. **→ YOU ARE HERE:** Copy Editing - Fix mechanical errors

**BEFORE YOU START:**
- Verify all `.suggestion.md` files from previous phases have been resolved
- This phase is MECHANICAL ONLY - do not rewrite prose or change structure
- If you find issues beyond typos/grammar, create a `.suggestion.md` file for appropriate phase

**CROSS-PHASE COMMUNICATION:**
- If prose needs rewriting → Create `.suggestion.md` noting need for line editing pass
- If character inconsistency found → Note in CHARACTER_HONING_LOG.md
- If structural issue found → Create `.suggestion.md` for structural audit review
- This phase should NOT create new suggestions - flag issues only

**COPY EDITING PRINCIPLE:** If it requires thought beyond "is this spelled correctly?", it's not copy editing.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: TOKEN MANAGEMENT

**Copy editing should be FAST and token-efficient:**

1. **Work ONE chapter at a time** - Scan, fix, verify, next
2. **This phase should use ~50k tokens total** (2-3k per chapter max)
3. **If you're spending >5k tokens per chapter, you're overthinking it**
4. **At 100k tokens:** You're doing something wrong - this should be mechanical

**Copy editing is the FASTEST phase. Don't turn it into line editing 2.0.**

## 🎯 YOUR TASK

Fix mechanical errors ONLY. Everything else is **LOCKED**.

### What You're Fixing:

**TYPOS:**
- Misspelled words
- Doubled words ("the the")
- Missing letters
- Wrong homonyms (their/there/they're)

**GRAMMAR:**
- Subject-verb agreement
- Tense consistency (except intentional present tense in Ch 21, Epilogue)
- Pronoun agreement
- Fragment sentences (unless intentional for style)

**PUNCTUATION:**
- Missing or extra commas
- Quotation mark errors
- Apostrophe mistakes (its vs it's)
- Em dash vs en dash consistency
- Ellipsis formatting (three dots)

**FORMATTING:**
- Consistent dialogue formatting
- Proper paragraph breaks
- Section break consistency (---)
- Italics usage (emphasis, internal thoughts)
- Bold usage (emphasis only where intended)

**CAPITALIZATION:**
- Proper nouns
- Titles (Dr. Webb, not dr. webb)
- Chapter headings
- First words after periods

---

## 📋 BEFORE YOU START

### 1. Prerequisites (MUST be complete):
- ✅ Character Honing complete
- ✅ Line Editing complete
- ✅ You've read this entire document

### 2. Create Your Tracking:
**Create `COPY_EDITING_LOG.md`** to track:
- Chapters completed
- Number of fixes per chapter
- Token usage (should be low!)
- Common error patterns

---

## 🔄 WORKFLOW: MECHANICAL SCAN

### For Each Chapter (15-20 minutes max):

**1. MECHANICAL SCAN:**
- Scan for obvious typos
- Check punctuation
- Verify grammar
- Note formatting inconsistencies
- **Don't read for content** - you've read it twice already

**2. FIX ERRORS:**
- Correct typos immediately
- Fix grammar mistakes
- Standardize punctuation
- Adjust formatting
- **No hesitation, no debate** - if it's wrong, fix it

**3. QUICK VERIFY:**
- Glance through edits
- Ensure no new typos introduced
- **Time limit: 2 minutes**

**4. DOCUMENT:**
- Count fixes made
- Note any patterns
- Mark chapter ✅ CLEAN
- **Move on immediately**

---

## ✅ EXAMPLE FIXES (Quick mechanical corrections)

**TYPO:** "Alex walked tot he door" → "Alex walked to the door"

**GRAMMAR:** "The patterns was rotating" → "The patterns were rotating"

**PUNCTUATION:** "Dad said 'I know'" → "Dad said, 'I know.'"

**HOMONYM:** "Their trying to communicate" → "They're trying to communicate"

**APOSTROPHE:** "Its a quantum system" → "It's a quantum system"

**FORMATTING:** "Chapter1: The Archive" → "Chapter 1: The Archive"

---

## ❌ WHAT NOT TO DO

**DO NOT:**
- ❌ Rewrite sentences for style (that was line editing!)
- ❌ Change word choice (already done!)
- ❌ Question character names or details (already honed!)
- ❌ Alter plot or beats (LOCKED!)
- ❌ Re-read for enjoyment (not your job right now!)
- ❌ Debate comma placement for 5 minutes (pick one, move on)
- ❌ "Polish while you're here" (NO! Just fix errors)
- ❌ Spend more than 20 minutes per chapter

**DO:**
- ✅ Fix obvious typos immediately
- ✅ Correct grammar errors mechanically
- ✅ Standardize punctuation quickly
- ✅ Work FAST
- ✅ Trust your eye
- ✅ Keep moving forward

---

## 📊 CHAPTER LIST (Same order as before)

**Speed targets:**
- Chapters 1-12: ~15 min each = 3 hours
- Chapters 13-15: ~15 min each = 45 min
- Chapters 16-22: ~20 min each = 2.5 hours
- **Total time: ~6-7 hours for all 22 chapters**

**If it's taking longer, you're overthinking it.**

---

## 🎯 COMMON ERROR PATTERNS TO WATCH FOR

**From this story specifically:**

**Consistency Items:**
- "Dr. Webb" vs "Marcus Webb" (use Dr. Webb in narration)
- "Polybius" vs "POLYBIUS" (italics for game name? check consistency)
- "sub-basement" vs "subbasement" (choose one)
- "PSU" vs "Portland State" (both fine, just be consistent per context)
- "k=17" vs "k = 17" (spacing in equations)

**Technical Terms:**
- "Bernoulli" (capital B)
- "oscilloscope" (one word)
- "tetrahedra" (plural of tetrahedron)
- "quantum" (never capitalized unless starting sentence)

**Dialogue:**
- Ensure all dialogue ends with punctuation inside quotes
- Verify dialogue tags are lowercase after quotes ("he said" not "He said")
- Check for missing closing quotes

---

## 📝 TRACKING YOUR WORK

Update `COPY_EDITING_LOG.md` after each chapter:

```markdown
## Chapter X: [Title]
**Status:** ✅ Clean
**Errors Fixed:** 8
**Types:**
- Typos: 3
- Punctuation: 4
- Grammar: 1
- Formatting: 0
**Time Spent:** ~15 minutes
**Tokens Used:** ~2,XXX
**Cumulative:** XX,XXX / 200,000
```

**Track your pace:**
- If spending >20 min per chapter → speed up
- If using >3k tokens per chapter → you're overthinking

---

## 🔋 TOKEN CHECKPOINTS

**This phase should be TOKEN-LIGHT:**

**Target: ~50k tokens for entire copy edit pass**
- That's ~2,200 tokens per chapter
- Should be achievable with focused scanning

**At 25k tokens (~10 chapters):**
- Good pace! Keep going.

**At 50k tokens (~all chapters):**
- You should be done or nearly done

**At 75k tokens:**
- Something's wrong - are you re-writing?
- Stop, assess, potentially skip remaining chapters

**If you exceed 100k tokens on copy editing, you're doing line editing again. STOP.**

---

## 🎨 STYLE REFERENCE

**Dialogue formatting (standard):**
```
"This is dialogue," Alex said.
"This continues," they added, "in the same sentence."
```

**Em dashes (for interruption/emphasis):**
```
Alex reached for the switch—then hesitated.
```

**Ellipsis (for trailing off):**
```
"I don't know if..."
```

**Italics (internal thoughts, emphasis):**
```
*This is wrong,* Alex thought.
The machine had been running for *years*.
```

**Section breaks:**
```
---
```

---

## 📚 REFERENCE TO LOCKED ELEMENTS

**Everything before this phase is LOCKED:**
- Story structure (BEAT_TRACKING.md)
- Continuity (CONTINUITY_REPORT.md)
- Character details (CHARACTER_REFERENCE.md)
- Place details (PLACE_REFERENCE.md)
- Sentence structure and word choice (Line Editing)

**You're only fixing:**
- Mechanical errors
- Typos and spelling
- Grammar and punctuation
- Formatting consistency

---

## 🚀 START SEQUENCE

1. Verify Line Editing is complete
2. Read this document completely
3. Create `COPY_EDITING_LOG.md`
4. Set a timer for each chapter (max 20 min)
5. Work mechanically through all chapters
6. Mark complete when all chapters are ✅ CLEAN

---

## ✅ COMPLETION

When all chapters are copy edited:
- Update this file with completion date
- Finalize `COPY_EDITING_LOG.md`
- Create final `EDITING_COMPLETE.md` summary
- **The novel is DONE!**

---

## 💡 PRO TIPS

**Speed strategies:**
1. **Use Find & Replace** for repeated errors
2. **Trust your first instinct** - if it looks wrong, it probably is
3. **Don't read for story** - you know the story, just scan for errors
4. **Set timers** - forces you to work efficiently
5. **Batch similar fixes** - do all comma checks at once, etc.

**Common traps to avoid:**
- "While I'm here, let me improve this sentence" → NO
- "This word choice could be better" → TOO LATE
- "Let me re-read this beautiful passage" → NOT YOUR JOB
- "Is this comma really necessary?" → PICK ONE, MOVE ON

---

**REMEMBER: Copy editing is MECHANICAL. Be a machine. Work fast. Get it done.**

**Speed > Perfection**

**The story is already good. You're just catching typos.**

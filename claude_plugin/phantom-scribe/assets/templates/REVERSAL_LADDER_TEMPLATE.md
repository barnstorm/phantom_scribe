# Reversal Ladder (Thriller Pacing Template)

Use this when you want Dan Brown / propulsive-thriller momentum: short scenes, constant pivots, and a clear “because of that…” chain.

This sits *below* your chapter grid:
- Macro: `HARMON_STORY_CIRCLE_TEMPLATE.md` (or other macro)
- Chapter rhythm: `CROUCH_PACING_SHEET_TEMPLATE.md`
- Scene engine: **this file** (reversals + cliff buttons)

## Core Idea

Every scene should contain a **reversal**:
- The character’s plan **changes**
- The meaning of information **changes**
- The power dynamic **changes**

At the end of the scene, the reader should be forced to turn the page because:
- A new constraint appears, or
- A prior assumption breaks, or
- The protagonist must act *now*.

## Reversal Types (pick one per scene)
- **New information**: a clue changes meaning.
- **Betrayal/realignment**: ally becomes obstacle (or vice versa).
- **Clock escalation**: less time than believed.
- **Access change**: door opens/closes (literal or social).
- **Cost reveals itself**: success is more expensive than expected.
- **Location inversion**: safe place becomes dangerous.
- **Authority shift**: someone gains/loses jurisdiction/credibility.
- **Competence swap**: the “expert” is wrong; the novice sees the truth.

## Cliff Buttons (end-of-scene hooks)
Use one:
- **Question** (What is it? Who did it?)
- **Threat** (Someone arrives / gun / legal threat)
- **Discovery** (hidden door, message, body, artifact)
- **Decision** (must choose now)
- **Contradiction** (evidence disproves the last conclusion)
- **Countdown** (time marker hits)

## Scene Ladder Grid

Fill this before drafting the chapter. Aim for 3–6 scenes per chapter in high-thrill mode.

| # | POV | Scene Goal | Plan | Obstacle | Reversal (type) | New Plan / Forced Move | Cliff Button | Notes |
|---:|-----|------------|------|----------|------------------|------------------------|--------------|------|
| 1 |     |            |      |          |                  |                        |              |      |
| 2 |     |            |      |          |                  |                        |              |      |
| 3 |     |            |      |          |                  |                        |              |      |

| 5 |     |            |      |          |                  |                        |              |      |
| 6 |     |            |      |          |                  |                        |              |      |

## “Because of that…” Chain (chapter-level)

After filling scenes, summarize the chain in 3–8 bullets:
- X happens → therefore Y → therefore Z …

If you can’t write this chain, you likely have a scene that doesn’t turn the story.

## Guardrails (avoid cheap reversals)
- Reversals must be **earned** by prior setup (even minimal).
- Avoid “random bad luck” as the only engine.
- Don’t add new canon facts in a reversal without recording them (use `accept-headcanon` if it’s adopting new facts; use `canon-keeper` if it changes rules).

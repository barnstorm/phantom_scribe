# Reverse Engineering Checklist (Improve an Existing Draft)

Use this when you have a complete (or partial) draft and want to rebuild the planning artifacts.

## 1) Create a 1–2 page thumbnail
- [ ] Logline
- [ ] Setup → escalation → midpoint flip → crisis → climax → resolution

## 2) Diagnose current vibe
- [ ] What genre does it *read* like right now?
- [ ] Where does pacing drag or spike?
- [ ] What do you want to preserve?

## 3) Rebuild structure artifacts
- [ ] Map draft to `HARMON_STORY_CIRCLE.md`
- [ ] Fill `PACING_SHEET.md` (question → answer → constraint → cost) per chapter
- [ ] If thriller: fill `REVERSAL_LADDER` for weak chapters
- [ ] If horror: fill `DREAD_LADDER` for escalation coherence

## 4) Sync canon (avoid “idea drift”)
- [ ] Update `world/WORLD_BIBLE.md` with only confirmed rules/facts
- [ ] Update `characters/CHARACTER_REFERENCE.md` (knowledge gating + relationships)
- [ ] Park unknowns in `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`
- [ ] If mystery: update `world/CLUE_LEDGER.md`

## 5) Run rinse/repeat
- [ ] After each rewritten chapter: `CHAPTER_DONE_CHECKLIST.md` (or `chapter-checker`)
- [ ] End of session: `END_OF_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md`

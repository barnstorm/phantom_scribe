# Clue Ledger (Template)

Use this for mystery/thriller plotting so reveals are earned and evidence doesn’t “teleport”.

## Case/Mystery Question
- **Central question:** _
- **Investigators:** _
- **Opposition:** _
- **Solution (private):** _Write the truth here so clues stay consistent._

## Clue Table

| ID | Clue | Type | Source | Introduced (Ch/Scene) | Confirmed (Ch/Scene) | What it points to | Who knows it | Risk/Notes |
|----|------|------|--------|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------|-----------|
| C1 |      | hard/soft/red herring |        |                        |                       |                   |              |           |

**Types**
- **hard:** factual evidence that must remain true
- **soft:** interpretive clue (can be misread)
- **red herring:** plausible but false lead

## Reveal Plan (Cadence)

| Reveal # | What is revealed | Trigger / cause | Cost | Chapter end hook |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|------|------------------|
| R1       |                  |                 |      |                  |

## Audit Checks
- Every reveal is supported by at least 1 hard clue + 1 soft clue.
- Red herrings are plausible and pay off (they teach something or cost something).
- Knowledge gating is respected (no one acts on a clue they don’t know).
- If you change the solution, re-audit all clue links.

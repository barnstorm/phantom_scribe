# End of Session Checklist (Phantom Scribe)

Use this at the end of every writing/editing session to prevent drift and “lost context”.

## Always (2–5 minutes)
- [ ] Write a 3–6 line summary of what changed (or what you drafted).
- [ ] Update `TODO_INDEX.md` (what’s done, what’s next).
- [ ] Update `BEAT_TRACKING.md` (confirm beat coverage; mark ✅/⚠️/❌).
- [ ] Append to `logs/IMPROVEMENTS_LOG.md` (date + summary + why).

## If You Drafted or Revised a Chapter
- [ ] Confirm chapter ends with motion (question/reveal/constraint/decision).
- [ ] Record the chapter’s start question → answer delivered → end constraint → cost (store in your pacing sheet or notes).
- [ ] If you added/changed any world rules, update `world/WORLD_BIBLE.md`.
- [ ] If you changed chronology/“X days later”, update your timeline notes (or run `timeline-keeper`).

## If You Used Headcanon Hooks
- [ ] Adopt selected hooks explicitly using `accept-headcanon` (don’t let hooks silently become true).
- [ ] Leave rejected hooks in “Candidates” (or delete them intentionally).

## If You Edited Dialogue
- [ ] Confirm knowledge gating (no character knows something too early).
- [ ] Confirm voices remain distinct (no mush).

## Set Up Next Session (1 minute)
- [ ] Write the next task as a single sentence (“Next: Draft Ch 05 scene 1–3 using reversal ladder.”)
- [ ] List any open questions/risk items (max 3) so they don’t leak.

# 📌 START HERE – PROJECT OVERVIEW (Template)

Use this as the first read for any serialized writing/editing project. Swap in your project name, current status, and phase-specific notes.

## Status Snapshot
- **Project:** _Name here_
- **Scope:** _e.g., 20 chapters + epilogue_
- **Current Phase:** _Drafting / Structural audit / Line edit / Copy edit_
- **Last Updated:** _YYYY-MM-DD_

## Phases (Sequential)
1) **Drafting:** Outline → beats → chapters.
2) **Structural Audit:** Check beat coverage, continuity, and timeline; note gaps.
3) **Line Editing:** Prose quality, voice consistency, pacing; apply per-chapter logs.
4) **Copy Editing:** Typos, grammar, formatting; final polish.

## Working Rules
- Keep beats and timeline consistent; lock plot before polishing prose.
- Log every pass (what changed, outstanding issues, word counts).
- Prefer one major task per session to avoid context loss.
- When in doubt, reread the prior chapter before editing the next.

## Token/Time Management (Optional)
- Set a per-session budget (tokens or time). At ~50% budget, wrap the current chapter and update tracking files.

## Key Tracking Docs (Templates)
- `BEAT_TRACKING_TEMPLATE.md` — Beat coverage/status table.
- `TODO_INDEX_TEMPLATE.md` + `TODO_ACT*.md` — Work planner by act/chapter.
- `CONTINUITY_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` — Findings and required fixes.
- `*_LOG_TEMPLATE.md` — Pass-specific logs (character, line, copy).

## Hand-off Guidance
- Update TODOs and logs at end of session.
- Note unresolved questions and risks.
- Call out any file numbering or naming conventions in use.
